Task 1
----

No more tickets left in "Intelligent Forum" event. Still left script at `Task1_old.py`. Added `Task1_new.py` where I went for "Trys Parsiukai" event to show something simmilar. Also, Google anti robot captcha tries to stop me from buying tikets with script.

Task 2
----

Elements in list starts counting from index 0 not 1. Fixed code in `Task2.py`.

Task 3
----

You can select elements in tables using "tr" and  "td" atributes. On simple text used double clicking and on links used click and hold to certain locations. File name `Task3.py`.

Task 4
----

To run test use: 
```commandline
pytest test_upper_case_file.py ("-s" "-v" optional)
```
To work test script `test_upper_case_file.py` must be placed in pytest_click_app-master directory. 
Test fails duo to something.output inconsistencies.
