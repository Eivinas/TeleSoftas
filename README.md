#Task 1	(Task1_old.py, Task1_new.py)
	No more tickets left in "Intelligent Forum" event. Still left script at Task1_old.py
	Added Task1_new.py where I went for "Trys Parsiukai" event to show something simmilar.
	Also, Google anti robot captcha tries to stop me from buying tikets with script.

#Task 2 (Task2.py)
	Elements in list starts counting from index 0 not 1. Fixed code in Task2.py

#Task 3 (Task3.py)
	You can select elements in tables using "tr" and  "td" atributes. On simple text
	used double clicking and on links used click and hold to certain locations.

#Task 4 (test_upper_case_file.py) To run test use: pytest test_upper_case_file.py ("-s" "-v" optional)
	To work test script must be placed in pytest_click_app-master directory. 
	Test fails duo to "something.output" inconsistencies.
